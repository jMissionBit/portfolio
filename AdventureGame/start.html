    <p>
        You find yourself trapped in an small empty room with 2 doors in a Mansion. 
        Which is probably maybe haunted. Y u ask? Idk I guess b/c its a cliche. 
        You should probably be more worried about getting out of here then some backstory.

    <p>ANYWAYS, pick one of the doors, otherwise I guess you could just turn off the game.
